# Manually curated annotations TSV file for non-geographical fixes
# The TSV should not have a header and should have exactly three columns:
# id to match existing metadata, field name, and field value
# If there are multiple annotations for the same id and field, then the last value is used
# Lines starting with '#' are treated as comments
# Any '#' after the field value are treated as comments.

# The following strains are missing temporal information, but are all genetically from the West-African 2013- outbreak
# and have informative strain names. Note: Geographic info updated in annotations_geo.tsv
# Ebola virus/H.sapiens-rec/LBR/2014/Makona-L2014
