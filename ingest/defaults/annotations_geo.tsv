# Manually curated annotations TSV file for geographical fixes
# The TSV should not have a header and should have exactly three columns:
# id to match existing metadata, field name, and field value
# If there are multiple annotations for the same id and field, then the last value is used
# Lines starting with '#' are treated as comments
# Any '#' after the field value are treated as comments.

# 1976 outbreak was entirely in Northen Zaire (DRC)
# From WHO bulletin "Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Zaire, 1976" <https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2395567/>
# "Between 1 September and 24 October 1976, 318 cases of acute viral haemorrhagic fever occurred in northern Zaire." 
# "most of the cases were recorded within a radius of 70 km of Yambuku, although a few patients sought medical attention in Bumba, Abumombazi, and the capital city of Kinshasa, where individual secondary and tertiary cases occurred."
# These strains have no geographic information, but genetically they're from the 1976 outbreak.
# Many don't have strain names. Where they do it's often "Mayinga" or "Yambuku-Mayinga"
# (Mayinga was the nurse incorrectly ID'd as the index, and the virus has been called "strain Mayinga", "variant Mayinga" or "EBOV/May")
# (Yambuku is the index village in Mongala Province)
