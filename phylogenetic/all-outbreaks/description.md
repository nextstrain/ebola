## Data provenance, Terms and Conditions, and Acknowledgements

The tree in this dataset sources sequences and metadata from Pathoplexus and includes RESTRICTED sequences.
These sequences were generously shared pre-publication by the authors to aid public health response.
It is not allowed to use these sequences in preprints or publications without permission of the authors, see [Pathoplexus data use terms](https://pathoplexus.org/about/terms-of-use/data-use-terms) for details.

Additional metadata was sourced from [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and INRB (DRC). For full details of the data curation steps please see the [ebola/ingest workflow](https://github.com/nextstrain/ebola/tree/main/ingest). This specific analysis was generated by the [ebola/phylogenetic/all-outbreaks workflow](https://github.com/nextstrain/ebola/tree/main/phylogenetic/all-outbreaks).

This work is made possible by the open sharing of genetic data among research groups led by the Ministry of Public Health of DRC, Hygiene and Prevention through INRB (DRC), all technical outbreak response teams within the INSP-COUSP and health division of the affected provinces.
