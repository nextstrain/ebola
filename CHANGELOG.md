# CHANGELOG

We use this CHANGELOG to document breaking changes, new features, bug fixes,
and config value changes that may affect both the usage of the workflows and
the outputs of the workflows. See the [changelog for the ncov
repository](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/blob/HEAD/docs/src/reference/change_log.md)
for an example of formatting.
